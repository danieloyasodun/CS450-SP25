In this assignment, you are required to build this website using HTML and CSS with a focus on Flexbox layout. Follow these steps to complete the assignment:

## Design and Layout ##
  - Utilize Flexbox exclusively for designing the layout of your webpage. Ensure that no other layout methods or frameworks are used. While the colors and fonts in your design do not need to match the sample exactly, it is highly recommended that you use a color picker tool to select colors that closely resemble those used in the sample.

## File Structure ##
  - HTML File: Edit the index.html file in your React project. This file should contain all necessary HTML code to construct your webpage.
  - CSS File: Create a CSS file named styles.css. This file should contain all the CSS code required to style your webpage.
  
## Deployment ##
  - Deploy your react project to GitHub Pages. Ensure that the webpage is accessible online through a GitHub Pages URL.
  
## Submission ## 
- Submit the following on Canvas:
 - The index.html file containing your HTML code.
 - The styles.css file containing your CSS code.
 - A link to your deployed webpage on GitHub Pages.
